#Web Developer Questions#

This project contains a number of problems to test your HTML and Javascript skills.

The rules are simple: you have a text editor, a web browser, and an internet 
connection. We aren't testing your knowledge of trivia, we're trying to see how 
you work. If you can't remember what a `DOCTYPE` declaration looks like, or what 
jQuery method to call to get the value of an `input`, Google it.

You can also ask us questions. If these instuctions are unclear, or if you just 
can't remember the right words for your Google search, ask us like we're a 
couple of guys sitting next to you at work, not a couple of sacry hiring 
managers out to shatter your hopes and end your carreer.

You can use whatever tools you're most comfortable with (jQuery, AngularJS, 
plain old Javascript, et cetera), to solve these problems.

For your reference, you can grab jQuery from:

<https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js>

And AngularJS from:

<https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.2/angular.min.js>
